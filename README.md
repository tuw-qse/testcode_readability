### Abstract: 
Purpose. 
The readability of software code is key for understanding and maintaining software systems and tests. Although several studies focus
on investigating the readability of software code, we observed limited research work that focuses on the readability of software test code. In industry practice,
a limited number of guidelines aim for improving and assessing the readability of software (test) code. Therefore, in this paper, we aim at investigating
the readability of test code from an academic perspective complemented by practical views, discussed in grey literature. Furthermore, we conducted a con-
trolled experiment in academic environment to investigate the readability of selected test cases based on combined scientific and practical views. 
Methods. First, we build on the Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) approach with focus on academic literature, complemented by practical aspects reported in grey literature. Second we investigate the perception of readability and understandability in a controlled experiment in academic environment. 
Results.
The result set of the SMS includes 16 studies for further analysis. The majority of publications focuses on readability investigations of automatically
generated test code (88%), often evaluated with surveys to access the readability of test code (44%). The analysis of grey literature includes 56 results.
We identified a set of commonly agreed influence factors that are relevant for academia and industry but also smaller sets of factors that are mainly dis
cussed in academia or industry with limited overlap. For a selected set of test cases we conducted a controlled experiment to collect knowledge on influence factors and the perception on the readability of test cases. For half of the test cases we showed that selected influence factors have a significant impact on
the readability. 
Conclusion. The readability of test code is of major interest in academia and industry practice. The results of the reported studies showed a common consensus on a set of influence factors to assess the readability of software test code. However, we also found factors that are more relevant for academia and others that are more relevant for industry. Based on the results, we see the need to bring together academic and industry viewpoints to achieve
a common view on the readability of software test code.
